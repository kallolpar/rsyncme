BUILD & TEST
There are few targets available: rsyncme_d, rsyncme, test executables.

To build rsyncme_d (daemon's executable):
	cd src
	make debug (or make release)

To build rsyncme (commandline executable):
	cd src
	make rsyncme-debug (or make rsyncme-release)
To build tests:
	cd src
	make test
To run tests:
	cd src
	make test-check
		Results are written in folder ./test/build/log. Short summary of run
		is saved in rsyncme_<timestamp>.log file. Detailed log is saved
		in rsyncme_<timestamp>.err. If you want to inspect intermadiate files
		created in test run, change RM_TEST_DELETE_FILES definition in file
		./test/include/test_rm.h to 0.


CLEAN
To clean rsyncme_d (daemon's executable) and rsyncme (commandline executable):
	cd src
	make clean
To clean tests (but not test logs):
	cd src
	make test-clean
To clean test logs:
	cd src
	make test-clean-logs
To clean test and test logs:
	cd src
	make test-clean-all
