BUILD & TEST
There are few targets available: rsyncme_d, rsyncme, test executables.

To build rsyncme_d (daemon's executable):
	cd src
	make debug (or make release)

To build rsyncme (commandline executable):
	cd src
	make rsyncme-debug (or make rsyncme-release)
To build tests:
	cd src
	make test
To run tests:
	cd src
	make test-check
		Results are written in folder ./test/build/release/log. Short summary of run
		is saved in rsyncme_test_<timestamp>.log file. Detailed log is saved
		in rsyncme_test_<timestamp>.err. If you would like to inspect intermadiate
		files created during test run, please change RM_TEST_DELETE_FILES
		definition in file test/include/test_rm.h to 0.
To build tests in debug mode:
	cd src
	make test-debug
		Output is written to ./test/build/debug.
To run tests built in debug mode:
	cd src
	make test-debug-check
		Results are written in folder ./test/build/debug/log. Short summary of run
		is saved in rsyncme_test_<timestamp>.log file. Detailed log is saved
		in rsyncme_test_<timestamp>.err. If you would like to inspect intermadiate
		files created during test run, please change RM_TEST_DELETE_FILES
		definition in file test/include/test_rm.h to 0.
